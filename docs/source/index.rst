The Basics
==========

```django-logicaldelete``` aims to provide a consistent interface for managing
logical deletion of models also reducing the need to implement functionality at
the model level:

#. Logical Deletion instead of Physical Deletion
#. Admin that can reveal which records are "Deleted" and allow you to reverse it.
#. Provides some short cuts in a Manager.
